You were in your room with the door shut.

Instead of yelling at you, he should have been parenting his kid by talking her down from whatever scared her and reinforcing the lesson that closed door means Knock and ask to come in."

6,AITA for having a dress code for our wedding?,8034,['YTA'],1596392698.0,"YTA for implementing a weird version of white tie

In what universe must white tie include heels? I don't own heels. I have been to several balls wearing jewelled flats.

And of course hair colour, piercings, tattoos etc. are completely outside the remit of a dress code.

I suspect instead of ""white tie"" you have a very constrained idea of some sort of ""classy"" event in mind, which of course is not classy at all. 

You are being a snob and a poor host. The idea of a dress code is to inform people of EXPECTATIONS of what to wear, not form a restrictive code. This is a formal event, not a nightclub, and you would be rude beyond belief to bar people from coming because they don't own or feel comfortable in the kind of clothes you want to see in your bloody photos. 

This should be an occasion to celebrate with your nearest and dearest. You are making it all about the look. 

The good news is that with this behaviour you are telling people who you really are."
7,AITA for refusing to help my wife‚Äôs parents,2902,['NTA'],1596402638.0,"NTA. They weren't just hateful and exclusionary towards YOU, they carried their hate over onto your CHILDREN. I honestly can't imagine why your wife is even considering giving them anything, especially in such a way that it would ""save their pride"" by hiding that it came from you; once they ostracized your children, your wife should have considered them dead to her."
8,AITA for telling my uncles and aunts to STFU?,4541,['NTA'],1596397365.0,"NTA - Tell your parents that when your family starts respecting you, you'll respect them.  They're not giving you the common courtesy they'd give a stranger.  Instead of blowing up in the future, next time they start in with these inappropriate comments, ask them why they think it's ok to comment on your weight.  If they keep going, I'd say, 'yeah, I  noticed you were putting on weight, too, but didn't want to seem rude in saying something.  You might want to start watching your diet, you ate quite a lot last time I saw you'.  Maybe getting a dose of how it feels to have someone say that to them will snap them out of this habit.  If all else fails, you can always say, 'I'm not interested in discussing my weight, thanks.'   And keep repeating until they finally get the message."
9,AITA for not paying for my dates meal?,2065,['NTA'],1596407660.0,"NTA. the person who asks to hang out should expect to at LEAST pay for themselves, if not both people. if he wasn‚Äôt able to pay he could‚Äôve just said ‚Äúhey, i want to hang out, but i don‚Äôt have a lot of money right now‚Äù and planned a free date, or at the least he could‚Äôve *asked* if you can cover it first. sure, you lied about not being able to pay his meal and left him at the restaurant, but he put you in an extremely uncomfortable position and it was really rude of him to just assume you‚Äôre going to be paying for everything."

They justified his behaviour, then put the blame on your wife for misinterpreting his behaviour. This is such a huge turn off. The company showed you it's views on how its employees are allowed to act. It's gross. Leave a bad review!

Running a household is not just about financial contribution, it's about being an adult partner to getting things done.   The fact that he won't even do a sink of dirty dishes, is an indication that he doesn't understand that or realize how disrespectful he's been all along in the relationship.

IMHO, your ultimatum was incomplete and long overdue.  You've allowed your experience with your kids' father to undermine your confidence in your totally justified expectations.  In this case, you boyfriend's employment status is actually a red-herring;  he's living with you and your children, he needs to shape up and be a full adult partner or move out.  

""She Divorced Me Because I Left the Dishes by the Sink"" - read it and think about how disrespectful his attitude has been all along."

You are working during the day; you aren't available to care for your nephews.

28,AITA for telling my friend he isn‚Äôt actually homeless?,386,['NTA'],1596414098.0,"NTA. I was accepted into college because I was homeless. Even though I didn't directly communicate that, the admissions officer assigned to me figured it out on his own. He even fast-tracked me for acceptance. Probably one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. Literally life-changing.  A lot of people let me crash on their sofa, fed me and/or allowed me to clean up. Even when they didn't have much themselves. But everything I owned fit into a cardboard box. I had no car, no money, one pair of shoes, the whole lot. There were times when I traded sex for a place to sleep. I burned through a lot of friendships. I was almost completely alone in the world for 8 years. Money to buy stuff when I needed it would have allowed me to not risk incarceration for stuff like shoplifting sanitary napkins. Shoplifting is not a fun game as portrayed in movies. It made my chest hurt, every time. So, yeah, your friend is being gross and I hope they grow the heck up soon."

31,AITA for snapping at my sister in law?,1821,['NTA'],1596383594.0,"NTA. 

Your SIL sounds entitled. Your niece is not your child nor is it your job to provide for her. If your inlaws are so concerned they should pay for her private school. You've been very generous and you have every right to be angry about how demanding she's become. You take care of your kid and she can take care of hers and be grateful for what she gets. It's not a competition and that's a horrible outlook for her to have. She's spoiled and it's time for her to grow up.

If your inlaws allow themselves to be controlled by her that's on them. It shows favouritism and weakness and she's in no position to be demanding anything. If they favor her child so much it will not do well for your kid in the future. It's time someone puts their foot down and tells her to get bent and to act like an adult. I wouldn't give her anything until she decides to woman up and apologize for being an ass.

Have your husband read the ""Don't Rock the Boat"" essay. He needs to realize that his daughter is something worth putting his foot down over. If you don't, she'll always be treated as a second class citizen."
32,AITA for not letting my friend live in my spare room?,436,['NTA'],1596409495.0,"Of course you‚Äôre NTA. People on Reddit are going to tell you he‚Äôs entitled and you should drop him, etc etc. But, my view of truth is, it sounded like he just banked the idea that he‚Äôd always have the option of living with you if things got really bleak. They likely are, but life has also moved on so, you‚Äôre not in the position to make the same offer. There is no problem in that. Friendships lie and grow in these difficult situations. He probably can‚Äôt see beyond his pain and frustration at the world right now. However, I‚Äôd recommend you let him know you‚Äôre always going to be his friend and hopefully, once he‚Äôs in a place to see beyond the hurt, you can pick up your friendship."

34,AITA for waking up my sleeping roommate?,1557,['NTA'],1596383675.0,"NTA. 
You dropped a bowl, accidents happen.
As much as being woken from your sleep is annoying, it's a shared/communal area. He can't expect complete silence in a room anyone can use, especially when he has his own room anyway. 

If he likes something against his back, can't he move the bed against the wall and place some pillows/cushions there?"
35,AITA if I didn't allow hookups during my wedding dress trip?,209,['NTA'],1596420778.0,NTA. The idea that she *had* to have sex anywhere is outrageous. She chose to do that over hanging out with her friends on an occasion that was obviously special to you.
36,WIBTAH for going no contact with my parents who are greiving the loss of my younger sister?,4563,['NTA'],1596364421.0,"NTA

At first, I was leaning towards a nobody's one vote until he started implying you may have murdered your sister. I understand everyone grieves differently. I even understand why he can't stand seeing you because of the pain. But there is no excuse for that. He needs to be talking to a therapist. Someone who can help him work through this in a healthy manner. I think you'd be in the right to give them complete space and perhaps test the waters again in a year or so. But you need to do what's best for you right now and not just take the abuse, even if it's motivated by grief.

Also, that particular statement screams of guilt to me. My guess would be he blames himself for your sister's death and is lashing out because of it, and you're just the nearest/easiest punching bag. So maybe keep that in mind for in the future, because hopefully, you'll be able to eventually rebuild that relationship once everyone has had time to deal with their grief."

Not to mention that your intention wasn‚Äôt to specifically throw away his gross T-shirt but to clean up his house and make him dinner to be nice because he was having a rough week. Your intentions were good.

Also as a side note, who uses a T-shirt their cheating ex-GF gave them as a cumrag AND claims it has sentimental value?! That‚Äôs not right."
38,"AITA for ""not supporting"" my friend coming out as gay?",500,['NTA'],1596401344.0,"NTA. You weren‚Äôt effusive, that‚Äôs not the same as being an asshole. I‚Äôd tell your friend that you support him when you see him again, though. When someone comes out, it‚Äôs not just about you being ‚Äúok‚Äù with it, it‚Äôs about him knowing that you‚Äôre going to be a good friend to him going forward. That reassurance may seem silly when you‚Äôve just said you were cool, but it‚Äôs really important because a lot of times LGBTQ people end up dealing with discrimination and even violence because of who they are (I say this as an LGBTQ person)."

43,AITA for stopping my daughter going to my mums house?,259,['NTA'],1596410356.0,"NTA

Nip this in the bud now.  We let my MIL watch my son for 2 weeks over Christmas.  When we dropped him off, he was sleeping in his own bed.  They had a crib for him and everything.  

My MIL decided that she wanted to make the most of every moment with him and kept him in the bed with her.  When we brought him home, he refused to sleep in his own bed.  He would cry for hours.  (He gets his stubbornness from me)

When my daughter was born, she thought she could watch her for a couple of weeks.  Nope, didn't happen.  Grandma pouted and whenever we told her why, she would say, 'I am a Grandma, I have to spoil them.""

My wife and I responded, 'We are her parents and have to deal with the consequences.'"
44,Aita for not allowing my twins father in their lives after he said horrible things during my pregnancy,90,['NTA'],1596429787.0,"NTA. Thing is, after that reaction and then no contact, if he was *genuinely* maturing, wanting to step up, he would be moving heaven and earth to earn your trust.

My sister is vegan and even when she was in her most hardcore phase she never would have thrown out anyone's food, but my parents also wouldn't have tolerated that nonsense. It's one thing to listen to someone preaching, it's a whole other to let them bully you into throwing out your own steak. 

And the fact that she started eating your fries and drinking your Coke I mean talk about adding insult to injury! She deserved to be yelled at and should absolutely pay you back for that food.

Also she's not saving any animals by throwing out burgers and steaks, the cows were already dead. She's just contributing to more waste. You should start throwing away her food and if your parents say anything tell them this is the precedent they set - apparently it's okay to throw food in the garbage that you don't like, right?

That being said, I *do understand their concern*. Not because 'how dare you wear what you want', or that attitude, and their sarcasm is out of line. They don't want to see you get hurt. Sexual assault is rampant on college campuses and if everyone is dressing conservatively but you're not, you will stand out, and there is a chance you'll become a target through no fault of your own. I still say wear whatever the hell you want, because victims of sexual assault are not at fault for their clothing choice, and when I was sexually assaulted, I was wearing pajama pants and a camisole in my dorm room so...pfft.

This may or may not be an indication of your future together i.e. will she put family members' wishes before yours in other areas?

69,AITA for snapping back at a father who got annoyed at me when I wouldn't let his young son use my binoculars?,472,['NTA'],1596383157.0,"NTA. Entitled parents are entitled. They talk dirty, you talked back. I see business as usual here, the only asshole is the father.

70,AITA for not giving my pregnant friend my old baby items after I found out she's selling them?,9619,['NTA'],1596335888.0,"NTA

I used to give my daughter's outgrown clothes to a SIL for my niece.  I NEVER saw my niece wear even one of these items.  SIL was either selling them or throwing them away.

I found a friend who had a younger daughter and started giving the clothes to her.  Every time I ran into her, her daughter was wearing something we had passed on.

Give your stuff to someone who will use it."
71,AITA for telling my mom to take down her post of me at the hospital?,1121,['NTA'],1596365462.0,"NTA. Jesus Christ, remember when older folks said kids used their phones too much? I member."
72,AITA for refusing to let my brother and SIL stay in my late daughter‚Äôs room after they were evicted?,9985,['NTA'],1596334019.0,"NTA.

Look demanding you pay their rent is way over the line. They could have asked to stay on your couch for a week while they try to get money together for plane tickets. They are adults, they have no children, so no excuse for them not being able to pony up money when there was unemployment with a 600 bonus on top of it."
73,AITA for telling my dad‚Äôs girlfriend she‚Äôs a bad Catholic despite the fact she goes to church because of her bedroom habits?,28,['YTA'],1596434503.0,"Lol are you sure you aren't Catholic? You're sure judgy enough to be one. /s

Your friend is fucking your sister, I don‚Äôt think any sane person would just be instantly cool with it"
76,AITA I turned away a girl during dinner with my family.,21,['NTA'],1596440525.0,"NTA. You hadn't been seeing each other anymore, and she showed up unannounced at your house. She may have had good intentions, but it's a little presumptuous to show up with no notice and then expect to be invited in to join a family event."
77,AITA for telling my mom it's not her place to name my child?,3013,['NTA'],1596345727.0,"NTA, It‚Äôs important to set some boundaries before the baby is born because it will only be harder after. Newborn babies are a magnet for unwanted advise from everyone. Maybe you could sit your mother down and try to explain it to her in a calm way? Write down some pointers beforehand so you know what you want to express."
78,AITA for telling my non-vegetarian flatmate to stop using my stuff?,157,['NTA'],1596400074.0,"NTA. First, why should you have to clean her mess at all? You didn‚Äôt use the stuff for yourself or eat her food so she should have cleaned it, especially since she used your stuff too. Secondly, she should have respect for your beliefs. If she is going to use your stuff to cook with, ask and then make sure they‚Äôre thoroughly cleaned. I am so glad I‚Äôve never had to deal with roommates."
79,AITA for telling my son they way he loves on his boyfriend is inappropriate?,1954,['YTA'],1596352242.0,Is this a joke? YTA obviously. Nose rubbing is inappropriate for 13/14 year olds? Seriously? Come on.
80,AITA for making a joke about a baby shower gift my friend got for my wife and I?,32,['YTA'],1596432709.0,YTA. $125 on a gift isn‚Äôt cheap and you weren‚Äôt even hosting an actual party for people to attend. Asking people to get on a zoom call to watch you open gifts and then insult them? Super tacky.
81,WIBTA for not going to my stepdaughter‚Äôs mother-daughter event because she made it clear I was a second or maybe even last choice?,39,['YTA'],1596426732.0,"YTA

This isn‚Äôt a competition. Why are you making it one?"
82,AITA for 'moving out' when my girlfriend is 7 months pregnant?,146,['NTA'],1596400346.0,"I started out intending to write about hormones and stuff but this is over the top and far deeper than hormones.

I've been pregnant. It makes you shitty and irritable and uncomfortable but it doesn't make you become violent or abusive.

NTA, and look into starting legal proceedings to make sure you get to see your kid."
83,AITA for insisting on having a wedding when I‚Äôm not paying for most of it?,30,['YTA'],1596430718.0,"YTA. Dont force people to pay for a wedding they dont want. If you want to push through, lower your cost and pay for it yourself."
84,AITA for bribing my school to change my grades?,61,['YTA'],1596416704.0,YTA. You did take advantage of something not many people have access to in order to get better grades. I had the same thing happen to me but being in a small rural public high school meant I had to eat it and go to a shitty state school. You're not fully recognizing that you did something that pretty much came from a place of entitlement and piggybacking off your parents status.
85,AITA for being angry at my boyfriend when he was really ungrateful about his birthday present?,33,['NTA'],1596428031.0,NTA. But I wouldn't even gift him with it at that point.
86,AITA for making a joke about my niece.,103,['NTA'],1596405008.0,"NTA. 5 months old don‚Äôt talk; the joke was perfectly fine and in no way offensive. Also, her child IS an infant. SIL sounds terrible."
87,AITA for telling my sister she doesn‚Äôt get to tell me my experience?,41,['NTA'],1596423346.0,"NTA. If the judge made those comments in open court, you know your family is toxic. You told your sis something she doesn‚Äôt want to hear and stood up for yourself. You are definitely not TA for protecting your mental wellbeing."
88,AITA for not taking in my grandchild after my son (29M) died?,20,['YTA'],1596437204.0,">I was unable to visit more myself as I was busy with work and had met someone new and wanted this relationship to work. 

YTA. Sounds more like you wanted your son to do all the work and kept wanting him to come to you. Seems like you weren't making an effort that much."
89,AITA for feeding my vegan wife meat?,16,['YTA'],1596441779.0,"YTA, I hope she divorces you. Are you sure you‚Äôre 30? You seem like you‚Äôre 10."

Hahahahahaha I love this so much. 

But YNTA. Just try to find middle ground: schedule some time together (date night? maybe you can squeeze in half an hour to go for a walk together if you're in a place where you can?) so that he knows he will have your company, and make it clear that ""from x to y, please do not disturb me. If you do, then I won't have time to actually spend time with you"". 

All the best, Lois."
91,AITA for turning on the AC and making my SO who has ‚Äúasthma‚Äù go into the bedroom?,26,['NTA'],1596432074.0,NTA. I‚Äôve got severe asthma and AC is literally the only way I can breathe in the heat. It decreases the humidity in the air and filters out pollens that can exacerbate the asthma.
92,AITA for telling my mom not to contact me without a lawyer - over a dog?,997,['NTA'],1596359860.0,"NTA - Just because she's your mom, that doesn't give her license to steamroll you like that.  I don't blame you for taking the nuclear option, your other firm boundary setting didn't work on her.  You finally found a way to keep her from being awful to you.  Enjoy the peace and good luck with your dog."
93,AITA for not letting my cousin win a game in Smash Bros?,15,['NTA'],1596440940.0,"This is kind of sweet. NTA but go talk to him so that his lesson today isn‚Äôt just to be able to beat people properly, but also to learn to not gloat"
94,AITA for being short & harsh with my husband,35,['ESH'],1596424813.0,"ESH- literally why on Earth are you together? I feel so sorry for your kids. Not only do you need a divorce, but *you* need to get a job and get your kids out of the house.

There is no possible healthy outcome for your kids in this situation in a house full of drug addicts and alcoholics. Your husband isnt the only one who needs to wake up and straighten out. Jfc."

96,AITA for not blowing my money on an art degree for my nephew?,18,['YTA'],1596438132.0,"YTA.

You said you would pay. Your sister trusted you.

The circumstances of your getting with you et husband weren't the best and your son may have issues as a result.
